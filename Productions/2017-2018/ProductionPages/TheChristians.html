						<b>Synopsis:</b> Twenty years ago, Pastor Paul's church was nothing more than a modest storefront. Now he presides over
						a congregation of thousands, with classrooms for Sunday School, a coffee shop in the lobby, and a baptismal font as
						big as a swimming pool. Today should be a day of celebration. But Paul is about to preach a sermon that will shake
						the foundations of his church's belief. A big-little play about faith in America and the trouble with changing your
						mind.</p>
