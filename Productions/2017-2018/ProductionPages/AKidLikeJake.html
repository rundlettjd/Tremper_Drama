						<p style="margin-top: 8px;"><b>Synopsis:</b> Twenty years ago, Pastor Paul's church was nothing more than a modest storefront.  Now he presides over a congregation of thousands, with classrooms for Sunday School, a coffee shop in the lobby, and a baptismal font as big as a swimming pool.  Today should be a day of celebration.  But Paul is about to preach a sermon that will shake the foundations of his church's belief.  A big-little play about faith in America and the trouble with changing your mind.</p>
					</div> -->

					<div style="text-align: left;">
						<p style="margin-top: 8px;"><b>Synopsis:</b> On the eve of the admissions cycle for Manhattan&#39;s most exclusive private schools, Alex and Greg have high hopes for their son Jake, a precocious four-year-old who happens to prefer Cinderella to G.I. Joe.  But as the process continues, Jake&#39;s behavior becomes erratic and perplexing, and other adults in his life start to wonder whether his fondness for dress-up might be cause for concern.  This story of a husband and wife struggling to do right by their son is a study of intimacy and parenthood and the fantasies that accompany both.</p>
