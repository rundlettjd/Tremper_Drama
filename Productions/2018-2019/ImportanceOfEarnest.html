		<b>Synopsis: </b>Responsible, mild-mannered Jack Worthing is harboring a couple of secrets. First, he is in love
		with his friend Algernon&#39;s cousin, Gwendolen. And second, they both think his name is Ernest. In fact, Earnest
		is Jack&#39;s imaginary alter ego &#045; a troubled younger brother he created so that he could do whatever he liked
		in London and no one would ever think to judge him. But when Algernon catches on to the scheme, he decides to be
		Ernest himself in order to woo Jack&#39;s lovely young ward, Cecily. Confusion and hilarity reign, as the ladies try
		to disentangle the stories of their respective Ernests and jump the seemingly impossible hurdles to marry the Ernest
		they respectively love.
